# MicrosoftPointFarm
Microsoft Point Farm is an program developed by me.

It is still in early development so don#t expect to much.

It is used to collect Edge Points wich can be redeemed for real money giftcards.

It only works on a 1920px x 1080px screen. 

The mousePosition.py file can be used to configure the mouse position in the main python code.
